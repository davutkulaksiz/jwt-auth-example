This is the code part of <a href="https://twitter.com/benawad"> Ben Awad</a>'s <b>JWT Authentication Node.js Tutorial with GraphQL and React</b> guide.

## Make sure to setup PostgreSQL for the GraphQL server

1. Install PostgreSQL on your computer
2. Create database called "jwt-auth-example"
3. [Add a user](https://medium.com/coding-blocks/creating-user-database-and-adding-access-on-postgresql-8bfcd2f4a91e) with the username "postgres" and and no password. (You can change what these values are in the [ormconfig.json](https://github.com/benawad/graphql-ts-server-boilerplate/blob/master/ormconfig.json))
